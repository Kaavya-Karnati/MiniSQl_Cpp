# MiniSQL: A Simple File-Based Database System

## Project Description:
MiniSQL is a lightweight database management system implemented in C++. It allows users to perform fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a structured dataset stored in a text file. This project simulates a simple database without requiring a full-fledged database engine, making it ideal for learning file handling, data persistence, and basic indexing.

## Features:
- **Insert**: Add new records with an ID, name, and age.
- **Select**: Retrieve and display a record based on a given ID.
- **Update**: Modify an existing recordâ€™s name and age using the ID.
- **Remove**: Delete a record using the ID.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data is saved in `database.txt` for retrieval across sessions.

## Technologies Used:
- C++ (File I/O, Data Structures, and Algorithm Implementation)
- Standard Template Library (STL) for efficient indexing using `unordered_map`
